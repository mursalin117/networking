This is a simple ftp server-client program. Here no password or username is used for logging in.
From the client, one can do these four thing using the command line interface- 

  1. Checking the files and folders of the server
  To do that one have to use command : ls

  2. Creating new Directory in the server
  Here the directory is created in the home directory of the server.
  To do it one have to use command : mkdir directory_name
  If the directory already exists, one can remove it or simply keep the original form.

  3. Uploading file to server from client
  One can upload a new file or existing file to the server from the client. The file will be uploaded
  from the home directory of the client to the home directory of the server. One can easily replace the
  existing file on the server or simply keep the original file.
  To do it one have to use the command : upload file_name(with format)

  4. Downloading file from server to client
  One can download file from the server home directory. If the file exists in client home directory,
  one can replace it or keep the original file.
  To do it, one have to use command : download file_name(with format)
